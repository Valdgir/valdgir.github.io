## About me

My name is Matthias, my profession is Java programming, and the unknown is a reason why I'm here. I have a beginning of something that might end as a [balloon shooting game](https://valdgir.github.io/99balloons/). If you're interested in switching your religious beliefs to atheism, read [my note](Valdgir-metamorfoza.md) in Polish.
